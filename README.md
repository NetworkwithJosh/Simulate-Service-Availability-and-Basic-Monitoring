# üåê Simulate Service Availability and Basic Monitoring

This project demonstrates the **Availability** principle of the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) security triad.  
Availability ensures that systems and services remain accessible when needed.  

In this lab, you will:  
- Start a simple Python web service.  
- Verify whether it‚Äôs running using **process checks** and **network checks**.  
- Simulate a service failure by killing the process.  
- Write a **basic monitoring script** that reports if the service is UP or DOWN.
